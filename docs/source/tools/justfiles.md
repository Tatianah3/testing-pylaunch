# Using the Justfile

This project includes a [`Justfile`](https://github.com/smorin/py-launch-blueprint/blob/main/Justfile) that defines useful commands for common development tasks. [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) is a simple command runner that helps standardize commands across your project.

To use these commands, first [install Just](https://github.com/casey/just#installation). You can view all available commands by running:

```bash
just --list
```

For a full list of available commands, refer to [this guide](../reference/cli_reference.md).
