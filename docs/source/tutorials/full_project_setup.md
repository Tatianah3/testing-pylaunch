# Full Project Setup

This tutorial will guide you through the end-to-end setup of a new project using the Py Launch Blueprint template. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional Python project with a pre-configured development environment, ready for production.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- `uv` package manager
- `just` task runner

## Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the Py Launch Blueprint repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smorin/py-launch-blueprint.git
cd py-launch-blueprint
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Next, install the project dependencies using `uv`:

```bash
uv pip install --editable ".[dev]"
```

This command installs the project in editable mode along with the development dependencies.

### 3. Set Up Pre-commit Hooks

Set up pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency:

```bash
uvx --with-editable . pre-commit install
```

### 4. Verify Installation

Verify that the installation was successful by running the following commands:

```bash
just check
```

This command runs all the checks, including linting, type checking, and tests.

### 5. Configure the Project

Update the project configuration files to match your project's requirements. This includes updating the `pyproject.toml` file with your project's metadata, dependencies, and settings.

### 6. Initialize Version Control

Initialize a new Git repository for your project and make the initial commit:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### 7. Set Up CI/CD

Configure the CI/CD pipeline for your project using GitHub Actions. The Py Launch Blueprint template includes a pre-configured GitHub Actions workflow in the `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` file. Customize this workflow to fit your project's needs.

### 8. Start Developing

You are now ready to start developing your project. Use the provided `just` commands to manage your development workflow.

For example, to run the tests:

```bash
just test
```

To format the code:

```bash
just format
```

To lint the code:

```bash
just lint
```

## Project Commands

- **Setup**: `just setup` or `uv pip install --editable ".[dev]"`
- **Format**: `just format` or `uvx ruff format py_launch_blueprint/`
- **Lint**: `just lint` or `uvx ruff check py_launch_blueprint/`
- **Type check**: `just typecheck` or `uvx --with-editable . mypy py_launch_blueprint/`
- **Test all**: `just test` or `uvx --with-editable . pytest`
- **Test single**: `uvx --with-editable . pytest tests/test_file.py::test_name`
- **All checks**: `just check`
- **Pre-commit**: `just pre-commit-run`

## Code Style Guidelines

- **Line length**: 88 characters (Black standard)
- **Types**: Strict typing required for all functions
- **Imports**: Sorted with relative imports preferred
- **Naming**: PEP 8 conventions enforced via Ruff
- **Errors**: Prefer explicit error handling over assertions
- **Tests**: Type annotations optional for test files
- **Security**: No hardcoded credentials, follow bandit rules

## Developer Environment

- **Python**: 3.10+ required
- **Package manager**: `uv` recommended, pip supported
- **IDE**: VS Code with Ruff, MyPy, and Pylance extensions
