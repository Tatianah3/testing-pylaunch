# Project Structure

The project uses a simple, maintainable structure:

```
py-utils/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projects.py      # Main script with all functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/          # Test files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_api.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_config.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_cli.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml  # Project and tool configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md      # Documentation
```
# Versioning and Release Management

This project uses automatic version management powered by Git tags and `setuptools_scm`. The version is dynamically generated during installation and build processes.

## Key Features
- **Automatic Versioning**: Version derived from Git tags (e.g., `v1.2.3` ‚Üí `1.2.3`)
- **Development Versions**: Unreleased commits show as `1.2.4.dev1+gabcdef12` (includes commit ID by default)
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions validate version-tag

### Taplo

Taplo is a TOML file formatter and validator integrated into the project's development workflow. It ensures consistent formatting of all TOML files (like `pyproject.toml`) across the project.

Key Features:
- **Automatic Formatting**: Formats TOML files on commit using pre-commit hooks
- **Configurable**: Custom formatting rules defined in `pyproject.toml`
- **VS Code Integration**: Works seamlessly with the VS Code TOML extension
- **CI Integration**: Verifies TOML formatting in GitHub Actions pipeline
- **Consistent Style**:
  - 80 character line width
  - 4-space indentation
  - Aligned entries and comments
  - Expanded array formatting

Usage:
```bash
# Using Just commands
just format-toml  # Format TOML files
just check-toml   # Check TOML formatting

# Direct commands
taplo format      # Format TOML files
taplo format --check  # Check TOML formatting
```

Format verification happens at multiple layers:
- Local development (VS Code + Just commands)
- Pre-commit hooks (automatic formatting on commit)
- CI/CD pipeline (verification on PRs and pushes to main)
- IDE integration (real-time formatting in VS Code)

## Workflow with Version Management

### Creating Releases
```bash
# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v0.0.2 -m "Release version 0.0.2"
git push --tags

# Verify version
uv run python -c "import py_launch_blueprint; print(py_launch_blueprint.__version__)"
```

### Daily Development with Version Management
```bash
# Install with development dependencies
uv pip install --editable ".[dev]"

# Check current version
uv run python -c "import py_launch_blueprint; print(py_launch_blueprint.__version__)"

# Build package
hatch build
```

#### Common `local_scheme` Options
| Scheme                | Example Output                     | Description                                  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `"no-local-version"`  | `1.2.4.dev1`                       | No commit ID or dirty flag                   |
| `"node-and-date"`     | `1.2.4.dev1+gabcdef12.d20231025`   | Commit ID and date                           |
| `"node-and-timestamp"`| `1.2.4.dev1+gabcdef12.1698249600`  | Commit ID and timestamp                      |
| `"dirty-tag"`         | `1.2.4.dev1+gabcdef12.dirty`       | Commit ID and dirty flag                     |

## CI/CD Automation
The pre-configured GitHub Actions workflow (`release.yml`) ensures a robust release process. Here's how it works:

### Workflow Steps
1. **Trigger**: Pushing a tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`) triggers the workflow.
2. **Checkout**: The repository is checked out with full Git history (`fetch-depth: 0`) to enable `setuptools_scm` version detection.
3. **Setup**:
   - Installs `uv` for fast dependency management.
   - Sets up Python using the specified version.
4. **Build**:
   - Installs build tools (`hatch` and `build`).
   - Builds the package using `hatch build`.
5. **Version Validation**:
   - Extracts the version from the Git tag (e.g., `v1.0.0` ‚Üí `1.0.0`).
   - Compares it with the package version generated by `setuptools_scm`.
   - Fails if there's a mismatch.
6. **Output**:
   - If successful, the built distributions are available in the `dist/` directory.

---

## Troubleshooting Versions

### Version Issues
- **Version shows 0.0.0**: Create initial Git tag (`v0.1.0`).
- **Version mismatch in CI**: Ensure GitHub Actions uses `fetch-depth: 0`.
- **Dirty version suffix**: Commit all changes before tagging.
- **Missing commit ID**: Check the `local_scheme` setting in `pyproject.toml`.

### Workflow Issues
- **Workflow not triggered**: Ensure the tag follows the `v*` format (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
- **Build failures**: Check the `pyproject.toml` configuration and dependencies.

---

## Customization for New Projects
When using this workflow as a template for a new project, update the following:

1. **Project Name**:
   Replace `py_launch_blueprint` with your package name in the version verification step:
   ```yaml
   PY_VERSION=$(uv run python -c "import your_package_name; print(your_package_name.__version__)")
   ```

2. **Python Version**:
   Update the Python version to match your project's requirements:
   ```yaml
   with:
     python-version: "3.11"  # Change to your required version
   ```

## Python Types Common Issues and Solutions
1. Third-party library types:
```bash
# Install type stubs for common libraries
pip install types-requests types-PyYAML types-python-dateutil
```

2. Ignoring specific lines:
```python
# mypy
reveal_type(x)  # type: ignore

# pyright
x = something()  # pyright: ignore
```

3. Type checking only specific files:
```bash
# mypy
mypy src/main.py src/utils.py

# pyright
pyright src/main.py src/utils.py
```

disallow_untyped_defs = true vs false
- Use `true` when starting new projects or working with teams experienced in type hints who want complete type coverage.
- Use `false` when adding types to legacy code, working with test files, or training developers new to type hints.

disallow_untyped_defs = true
```python
# This will raise an error
def process_data(data):  # Error: Function is missing type annotations
    return data + 1

# This is required instead
def process_data(data: int) -> int:
    return data + 1
```

disallow_untyped_defs = false
```python
# This is allowed
def process_data(data):
    return data + 1

# This is also allowed
def process_data(data: int) -> int:
    return data + 1
```
